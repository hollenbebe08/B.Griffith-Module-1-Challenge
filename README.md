# Project Title: Refractor of Horiseon Website

⚙️ Main goals of the project:
    1. Update codebase to follow accessibility standards and optimize the site for search engines </br>

*When I view the structure of the HTML elements - then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning </br>
*When I view the image elements - then I find accessible alt attributes </br>
*When I view the heading attributes - then they fall in sequential order </br>
